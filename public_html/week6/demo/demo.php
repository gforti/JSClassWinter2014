              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                over seventy years, New England Institute of Technology has met 
                the challenge of preparing its graduates to enter an increasingly 
                competitive workplace. Founded in 1940 as the New England Technical 
                Institute, the present college began as a certificate-granting 
                trade school. In 1971, a new administration, under the leadership 
                of President Richard I. Gouse, envisioned a degree-granting institution 
                that would not only be better qualified to meet industry’s 
                need for technically-trained workers, but would also become one 
                of the top technical colleges in the nation.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                the Board of Regents of the State of Rhode Island granted the 
                institution the authority to offer associate degrees in 1977, 
                its name was changed to <strong>New England Institute of Technology</strong> 
                (<strong>NEIT</strong>). In 1982, <strong>NEIT </strong>was accredited 
                by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). 
                Two years later, in addition to associate degrees, the State of 
                Rhode Island authorized <strong>NEIT</strong> to confer baccalaureate 
                degrees and such other degrees, earned and honorary, as are usually 
                conferred by colleges and universities in addition to its associate 
                degree programs. By 1990, four new bachelor’s programs had 
                been added to the College’s offerings. In 1995, the New 
                England Association of Schools and Colleges’ Commission 
                on Technical and Career Institutions awarded accreditation to 
                <strong>NEIT</strong> as a baccalaureate-granting institution. 
                In 2005, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges continued 
                <strong>NEIT</strong>'s accreditation through its Commission on 
                Institutions of Higher Education. In 2010, the College began enrolling 
                students for its first master of science degree program.</font></p>

            <div align="left"> 
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, 
                enrollment has grown to more than 2,800 students from the 70 students 
                enrolled in 1971. The original educational programs have increased 
                to over 40 associate, bachelor’s and master’s degree 
                programs in such diverse fields as automotive technology, business 
                management, criminal justice, information technology, electronics 
                systems engineering technology, mechanical engineering technology, 
                nursing, occupational therapy, surgical technology, and video 
                and audio production. The campus that started in an older mill-style 
                building in Providence, Rhode Island, now encompasses three locations; 
                two in Warwick and one in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and includes 
                seven buildings with approximately 500,000 square feet of state-of-the-art 
                classroom, laboratory, faculty and administrative office space.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                dynamic changes to its program offerings and physical plant symbolize 
                <strong>NEIT</strong>’s vanguard journey into the 21st century 
                and its response to the radical transformation that new technologies 
                have brought to the workplace. The needs of tomorrow’s students 
                demand access to those technological resources that will enable 
                them to realize technology’s full potential to change their 
                education and their lives. As it has since its beginning, <strong>NEIT</strong> 
                has chosen to meet that challenge: the success of the College 
                will continue to be measured by its graduates’ accomplishments 
                in the world they are entering both as workers and citizens.</font></p>
